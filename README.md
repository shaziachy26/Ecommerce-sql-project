# Ecommerce-sql-project
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to uncover valuable business insights. Using PostgreSQL, I performed in-depth SQL analysis across six key areas: customer insights, trend analysis, regional performance, product insights, and sales analysis. The analysis was conducted on datasets sourced from Kaggle, which include transactional and customer data. Additionally, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the findings and extract deeper insights, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.
